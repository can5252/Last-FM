# LAST - FM APP

- The project shows the top 10 tracks and top 10 artists listened in Spain in March 2020. <br/>
- I created charts with [Highcharts](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-react). <br/>
- I got data from [the Last FM API](https://www.last.fm/api/). <br/>
- I used [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to get data from [the Last FM API](https://www.last.fm/api/).
